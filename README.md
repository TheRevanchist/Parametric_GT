# Parametric_GT

This code implements paper:

Ismail Elezi, Alessandro Torcinovich, Sebastiano Vascon, Marcello Pelillo: Transductive Label Augmentation for Improved Deep Network Learning, ICPR 2018, Beijing, China.

The code is quick and dirty, and while it can be used to replicate the results on the paper, it is not mantained anymore. Instead, use the new version of the code (which is written for readability and 
extends this code) which can be found at: https://github.com/AreTor/labaug

That code replicates the results of this code.
